    abstract = {This paper proposes a novel switched state observer of hybrid system using Luenberger sliding mode observer to estimate crankshaft angular acceleration which is further applied to detect misfire fault. The output error of hybrid system of internal combustion engine (engine speed) and the designed observer (estimated speed) is taken as input of observer to estimate crankshaft acceleration. Convergence of hybrid system is proven through Lyapunov stability theory. The experimental results show that the presented estimated technique has a higher accuracy and can be effectively used to misfire detection compared with reduced-order observer and sliding mode observer.},
