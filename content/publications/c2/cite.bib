abstract = {The interest in engine indicated torque estimation plays an important role in the automotive industry. In this study, an optimized Luenberger sliding mode observer is proposed based on easily available crankshaft angular speed of a four-cylinder spark ignition (SI) engine. Especially, the new observer is applied to track crankshaft angular speed and estimate engine indicated torque in New European Drive Cycle (NEDC). Convergence is proven through Lyapunov stability theory. The experimental results show that the proposed estimated technique can effectively track speed and has a higher accuracy in steady state.}
