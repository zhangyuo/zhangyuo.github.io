Welcome ðŸ‘‹

In April 2025, I started my PhD at Aalborg University focusing on **explainable Graph Neural Networks** (GNNs).  
By September 2025, I submitted my first research paper to *ICLR 2026*, exploring novel methods for faithful and interpretable GNN predictions. This marks an exciting step in my ongoing research into **GNN explainability, robustness, and trustworthy AI**.
